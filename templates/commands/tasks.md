$ARGUMENTS
```

**Important:** We'll vibe with whatever you've shared above (if it's not empty)!

## ðŸŽ¯ Breaking It Down

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow** (follow the template structure):
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - **Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)**
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities â†’ map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Each file â†’ map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions â†’ generate setup tasks
   - **Generate tasks ORGANIZED BY USER STORY**:
     - Setup tasks (shared infrastructure needed by all stories)
     - **Foundational tasks (prerequisites that must complete before ANY user story can start)**
     - For each user story (in priority order P1, P2, P3...):
       - Group all tasks needed to complete JUST that story
       - Include models, services, endpoints, UI components specific to that story
       - Mark which tasks are [P] parallelizable
       - If tests requested: Include tests specific to that story
     - Polish/Integration tasks (cross-cutting concerns)
   - **Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature spec or user asks for TDD approach
   - Apply task rules:
     - Different files = mark [P] for parallel
     - Same file = sequential (no [P])
     - If tests requested: Tests before implementation (TDD order)
   - Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.vibedraft/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - **Phase Progress Overview table** at the top with:
     - One row per phase with phase number, name, initial status (ðŸ”´ Not Started), task count, 0 completed, and empty progress bar
     - Calculate actual task counts for each phase
     - Example: `| 1 | Setup | ðŸ”´ Not Started | 3 | 0 | â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 0% |`
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
     - Each phase includes: story goal, status (ðŸ”´ Not Started), progress (X/Y tasks complete), independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
     - Clear [Story] labels (US1, US2, US3...) for each task
     - [P] markers for parallelizable tasks within each story
     - Phase checkpoint markers after each story phase
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - Numbered tasks (T001, T002...) in execution order
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count across all phases
   - Phase breakdown (number of phases and their names)
   - Task count per phase
   - Parallel opportunities identified per phase
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Reminder to update phase progress overview table as tasks complete

Context for task generation: {ARGS}

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Tests are optional. Only generate test tasks if the user explicitly requested testing or TDD approach in the feature specification.

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)
   
2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint â†’ to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract â†’ contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase
   
3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity â†’ to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships â†’ service layer tasks in appropriate story phase
   
4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure â†’ Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks â†’ Foundational phase (Phase 2)
     - Examples: Database schema setup, authentication framework, core libraries, base configurations
     - These MUST complete before any user story can be implemented
   - Story-specific setup â†’ within that story's phase

5. **Ordering**:
   - Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - must complete before user stories)
   - Phase 3+: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
     - Within each story: Tests (if requested) â†’ Models â†’ Services â†’ Endpoints â†’ Integration
   - Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
   - Each user story phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
