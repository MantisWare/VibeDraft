## ⚠️ Implementation Risks

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance**: Large projects may slow down
   - *Mitigation*: Caching, lazy loading, worker threads

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes break existing workflows
   - *Mitigation*: Deprecation warnings, migration guides

3. **Complexity**: Too many features overwhelm users
   - *Mitigation*: Optional features, progressive disclosure

### Business Risks
1. **Resource Allocation**: Development takes longer than planned
   - *Mitigation*: Phased rollout, MVP approach

2. **User Adoption**: Teams don't use new features
   - *Mitigation*: User testing, documentation, training

3. **Maintenance Burden**: More features = more bugs
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, automated QA

## 🚀 Quick Start

To begin implementation:

1. **Week 1**: Create feature specs using VibeDraft itself! 
   ```bash
   vibedraft init enhancements-project --ai cursor
   cd enhancements-project
   # Draft each enhancement as a feature
   /vibedraft.draft "Git Hook Integration for workflow enforcement"
   ```

2. **Week 2**: Review and refine specs with team

3. **Week 3**: Start implementation with Tier 1 features

4. **Week 4**: Alpha testing and feedback
