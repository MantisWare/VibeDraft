# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Primary**: Implementing Cursor Memory Bank system for persistent project context
- **Secondary**: Ensuring all documentation is consistent and vibey
- **Immediate**: Setting up complete memory bank structure with project-specific content
- **Next**: Testing memory bank effectiveness across Cursor sessions

## Recent Changes
- **Complete Rebranding** - Changed from "Specify" to "VibeDraft" throughout entire codebase
  - Updated all CLI commands and slash commands
  - Changed `vibedraft.specify` to `vibedraft.draft` for more vibey naming
  - Removed all "Specify" brand references from documentation
  - Maintained verb usage like "doesn't specify" where grammatically correct

- **README Overhaul** - Completely rewrote README.md to be comprehensive and vibey
  - Added full feature coverage (CLI commands, slash commands, scripts)
  - Included visual workflow diagram
  - Added quick reference sections
  - Injected personality and energy throughout
  - Documented all 8 AI agent integrations

- **Vibey Messaging** - Updated all user-facing messages to be fun and energetic
  - CLI output messages with emojis and personality
  - Template command descriptions
  - Error messages more friendly and actionable
  - Success messages celebratory

- **Documentation Consistency** - Scanned and updated all Markdown files
  - Removed old "Specify" references
  - Updated command examples
  - Ensured consistent terminology
  - Fixed file paths and directory references

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Create complete Memory Bank directory structure
2. ✅ Populate all 6 core memory bank files with VibeDraft-specific content
3. Verify memory bank files are comprehensive and accurate
4. Test that Cursor can read and utilize the memory bank

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Add additional context files in Notes/ folder as needed
2. Refine memory bank content based on usage
3. Document any new patterns or decisions in systemPatterns.md
4. Update progress.md as features are completed

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Community feedback on VibeDraft experience
2. Potential new AI agent integrations
3. Template improvements based on user feedback
4. Documentation refinements

## Active Decisions

- **Memory Bank Structure**: Following standard Memory Bank guide exactly for consistency
  - All 6 core files (projectbrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext, progress)
  - Notes/ folder for additional context as needed
  - core.mdc and memory-bank.mdc for Cursor rules

- **Vibey Brand Consistency**: Maintaining fun, energetic tone throughout
  - Use emojis appropriately (not overwhelming)
  - Celebratory success messages
  - Friendly error handling
  - Keep technical accuracy while being approachable

- **Command Naming**: Using `/vibedraft.draft` instead of `/vibedraft.specify`
  - More casual and vibey
  - Better aligns with brand personality
  - Clearer action verb for users

## Current Challenges
None - Project is in excellent state with:
- Full feature parity with Python original
- Complete rebranding to VibeDraft
- Comprehensive documentation
- Memory Bank implementation in progress

## Context Notes
- **Development Approach**: Following "Code Quality Rules" from user rules
  - Use `??` instead of `||` for nullish checks
  - Never build locally (dev server in separate terminal)
  - TypeScript-first when possible, modern JavaScript fallback
  - Explicit comparisons, no truthy/falsey ambiguity

- **Project Structure**: Well-organized with clear separation
  - `/commands/` - CLI commands (init, check)
  - `/lib/` - Utility libraries (banner, download, git, tracker, ui, utils)
  - `/scripts/` - Automation (Node.js and PowerShell versions)
  - `/templates/` - All spec, plan, task templates
  - `/docs/` - User documentation

- **User Preference**: Wants VibeDraft to be funky and vibey
  - Not just functional, but fun to use
  - Clear but entertaining documentation
  - Personality in error messages and success states
