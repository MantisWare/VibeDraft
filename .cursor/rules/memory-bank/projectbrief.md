# Project Brief

## Project Name
VibeDraft - The Vibey Spec-Driven Development CLI

## Objective
Create a delightfully vibey JavaScript/Node.js CLI toolkit that makes Spec-Driven Development accessible, fun, and powerful. VibeDraft transforms ideas into reality by providing a structured workflow where specifications become executable blueprints that AI coding assistants can implement.

## Scope
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for project initialization and environment checking
- **Slash Commands**: 8 AI agent commands for the complete SDD workflow
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Compatible with 8+ AI coding assistants (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.)
- **Cross-Platform**: Full support for Unix/Linux/macOS (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell)
- **Template System**: Pre-built templates for specs, plans, tasks, and checklists
- **Git Integration**: Automatic branch creation and feature numbering
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive, vibey documentation and examples

## Deliverables
- **vibedraft-cli** npm package with global installation support
- **Project templates** for all document types (spec, plan, tasks, checklist)
- **8 slash commands** for AI agents (constitution, draft, plan, tasks, implement, clarify, analyze, checklist)
- **Automation scripts** in both Bash and PowerShell
- **Comprehensive documentation** including README, quickstart, installation guides
- **Agent integration guides** for adding new AI assistants

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Developers using AI coding assistants
- **Secondary**: Development teams adopting Spec-Driven Development
- **Technical**: AI coding assistant tool creators

## Key Features

1. **Project Initialization**
   - One-command project setup
   - Auto-detects platform (Unix/Windows)
   - Configures chosen AI agent
   - Sets up Git repository with initial commit
   - Creates complete directory structure

2. **Spec-Driven Workflow**
   - Constitution: Define project principles and patterns
   - Draft: Create feature specifications from natural language
   - Clarify: Ask targeted questions to remove ambiguity
   - Plan: Generate technical implementation plans
   - Analyze: Verify consistency across artifacts
   - Tasks: Break down into actionable, sequenced steps
   - Checklist: Generate quality validation checklists
   - Implement: Execute implementation with AI assistance

3. **Multi-Agent Support**
   - Command file generation for each agent type
   - Format adaptation (Markdown for most, TOML for Gemini/Qwen)
   - Agent-specific directory structures
   - Argument placeholder handling per agent

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Bash scripts for Unix/Linux/macOS
   - PowerShell scripts for Windows
   - Auto-detection with manual override
   - Platform-specific script permissions

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Funky, vibey documentation tone
   - Clear error messages with actionable guidance
   - Progress tracking with visual feedback
   - Colored terminal output with emojis

## Success Criteria
- CLI installs and runs on Node.js 18+ across all platforms
- All 8 slash commands work correctly with all supported AI agents
- Scripts auto-select correct platform or accept manual override
- Git integration works seamlessly for feature branches
- Documentation is clear, comprehensive, and engaging
- Users can go from idea to implementation in < 30 minutes

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Port Python CLI to Node.js with full feature parity
- **Phase 2 (Complete)**: Rebrand from "Specify" to "VibeDraft" with vibey personality
- **Phase 3 (Complete)**: Update all documentation and ensure consistency
- **Phase 4 (Current)**: Memory Bank implementation for Cursor persistence
- **Phase 5 (Future)**: Community contributions and agent ecosystem growth

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must work on Node.js 18.0.0+
- **Compatibility**: Must support all major platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies for reliability
- **User Experience**: Commands must feel natural and intuitive
- **Performance**: Project initialization should complete in < 10 seconds
